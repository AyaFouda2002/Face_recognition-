## Abstract
A Face Recognition project utilizing linear algebra and the face recognition library involves the identification and verification of human faces in digital images or video. This technology relies on mathematical concepts from linear algebra to analyze and compare facial features.Linear algebra plays a crucial role in face recognition algorithms by representing facial images as high-dimensional vectors. These vectors capture essential facial attributes such as the positions and relationships of facial landmarks, color values, and texture information. By transforming images into numerical representations, linear algebra enables efficient computation and analysis of facial features.The face_recognition library is a popular open-source Python library that provides a simple interface for face recognition tasks. It utilizes deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to extract meaningful facial features. These features are then compared against a database of known faces or used for facial identification.

## Introduction
Face recognition is a field of computer vision that involves identifying and verifying the identity of an individual from a digital image or video frame of their face. Linear algebra is a fundamental tool in this area, as it provides a mathematical framework for representing and manipulating image data. Face recognition systems are a major topic since there has been an increasing number of institutional, military, and commercial applications in recent years. Such systems must operate with extreme precision and accuracy in order to be dependable. A face recognition system's database is made up of pictures of the people the system must be able to identify. Whenever possible,Â the database should have multiple pictures of the same person. As opposed to the situation when only one image of each person is saved in the database, the problem can be solved more quickly if the photographs are chosen to account for various facial expressions, lighting situations, etc. The taken image is processed by a facial recognition algorithm, which then compares it to photographs in the database. If a match is discovered, the person is recognized. The person is reported as unidentified if no match is discovered. 
One important concept in face recognition is the use of eigenvectors and eigenvalues to represent images. The basic idea is to represent an image as a set of numerical values, where each value represents the intensity of a particular pixel in the image. These values can be organized into a matrix, known as the image matrix.
The image matrix can be decomposed into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which provide a way to represent the image in a compressed form. While the eigenvalues depict the degree of variation in each direction, the eigenvectors depict the directions in which the picture fluctuates most. By selecting a subset of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
